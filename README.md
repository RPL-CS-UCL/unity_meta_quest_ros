# unity_meta_quest_ros

this package contains the unity app and all the necessary dependencies to stream the meta quest information device over Ros Noetic. i Have only tested the app on board the meta quest visualizer but maybe with the app onboard the windows computer more can be done in term of perfomance

# installation guide





# TODO list
- [ ] make installation guide
- [ ] testing sending data over ros
- [ ] add buttons and create the publisher 
- [ ] make flat inside Ros
- [ ] replace the sphere with the shape of the controller (looks nicer)
- [ ] test sending 2d images from cameras to meta quest (I'm expecting a low frame rate here, -> maybe downsampling and upsampling images could help)
- [ ] test sending 3d images from camera to meta quest for fully immersive operation (I'm expecting a very low frame rate here)
- [ ] test with the Windows app rather than the android app
